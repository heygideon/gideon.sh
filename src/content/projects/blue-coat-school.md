To commemorate the 2024 Olympics in Paris, my school organised a mini 'Olympics' with quizzes, competitions and sport events.
As part of this, I was asked to make an app that shows a live leaderboard so students could see how their house was doing.

A week later, the website was live for students 🎊

Students and teachers could quickly and easily log in using their school email account.
Everyone could view leaderboards, broken down by whole school and year group, to encourage _friendly_ competition,
and teachers running the event could add events and enter scores, with 100% less Excel.

Over 120 students and teachers signed up in the first day, and I got really positive feedback! My leaderboards were used in closing assemblies to announce winners.
