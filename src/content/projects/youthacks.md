In Autumn 2025, I took on the role of redesigning the Youthacks public website. We're an organisation that runs hackathons, coding events and game jams, and wanted our website to showcase photos from our events and to reflect the joy we bring to young people.

The new site includes a new design (which I love!), as well as a new tagline, _'We are makers'_, to show community and allude to our focus on making and sharing awesome projects with friends, not just 'coding'.

I added new pages for all our past events, with sponsors and on-the-day photos, as well as a space on the homepage to promote future events.
